# Task 3: Collaboration and Pull Requests

### Objective
Work with at least **one group member** to collaborate on GitHub using branches and Pull Requests (PRs).

---

### Step 1: Fork and Clone
Each group member forks the repository to their own GitHub account and clones it locally.

---

### Step 2: Create a New Branch
Each member creates a new branch (e.g., `group-member-edits`) using the **GUI** tools from Task 2.

---

### Step 3: Make Collaborative Changes
Modify `hello-world.cpp` to add one more `cout` line showing who added that contribution, e.g.:
```cpp
cout << "Edited by [Teammate Name]" << endl;
```

---

### Step 4: Push and Open a Pull Request
1. Push your branch to GitHub.  
2. On GitHub, open the repository page.  
3. Click **Compare & pull request**.  
4. Add a short title and message, then **Create pull request**.  
5. A teammate should **review and merge** your PR.

---

### Step 5: Celebrate ðŸŽ‰
Youâ€™ve now collaborated on a GitHub project using GUI tools only!
